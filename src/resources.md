# Ricing Resources

This is a collection of resources for ricing. Most of these places center around the ricing community, but there are a few other relevant links

General Resources:

- [Awesome Ricing](https://github.com/fosslife/awesome-ricing) - A *very* large list of software and tools for ricing.

Communities:

- [r/unixporn](https://reddit.com/r/unixporn) - The original ricing community
- [r/unixart](https://reddit.com//unixart) - A much more quality rice focused community (not so far as elitist though)

Linux Resources:

- [r/linux4noobs](https://reddit.com/r/linux4noobs) - A new-user oriented subreddit
- [r/linux](https://reddit.com/r/linux) - The oldest linux subreddit. Generally no a place to ask questions.
